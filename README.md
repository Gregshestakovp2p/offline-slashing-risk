# offline-slashing-risk
Previously, Lido purchased slashing insurance from Unslashed Finance that approximately cost [~25%](https://research.lido.fi/t/renewal-of-slashing-cover-from-unslashed/744) of the DAOâ€™s yearly revenues. Lido stopped using an Unslashed cover and [voted in favor of exploring self-cover](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/QmWeMuwkLJ3strPAM58kzLaKzbEPrWTLb1VC93ergrYrbv). This post is setting up the stage in terms of outlining the landscape and  possible developments.   We outline the typical risk scenarios (now, after Altair hardfork, and in the hypothetical future), the amounts of slashings and penalties, and evaluate impact to understand whether Lido can self-cover the losses.   The most realistic impact is low enough for self-cover to be a viable option, but not low enough to be completely trivial. Risk can be significantly reduced by non-financial actions, like promoting validator diversity and operator distribution, and putting in place mechanisms to maintain high validation quality standards.
